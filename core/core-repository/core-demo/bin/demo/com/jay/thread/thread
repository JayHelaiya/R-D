1) what is multitasking ? 

	executing multiple task simultaneously 
	
	multitasking 
		- process based multitasking
		
				- executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent process
				- example while programming same time listening music downloading file here each task is separate independent program 
				- it suitable at OS level	
				
		- thread based multitasking
		
			-  executing several task simultaneously where each task is separate independent part of the same program
			-  one program but multiple independent parts 
			-  it suitable at programming level	
			
2)	what is thread ?

	- separate flow of execution , each flow has independent job  
	
3)  define a thread  
	- we can  define a thread following two ways 
		- by extending thread class
		- by  implementing Runnable interface
		
		
4) thread scheduler ?

	- is part of JVM 
	- it is responsible to scheduler thread execution
	- if multiple thread waiting to get chance in which order they are going to execute is decided by thread scheduler
	- in which order they are going to execute is not decided because what is algorethem follow thread scheduler , it is vary to JVM to JVM
	
5) what is different between  t.run(); and t.start();	

	- run method will call as normal method 
		
		- t.start();
			is responsible  to register thread with thread scheduler and all another maendotery activity hence without executing thread.start menthod ,there is not chance of staring a new thread in java

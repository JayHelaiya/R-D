why collection freamwork is needed ? 

- due to array limitation 
	- fix sized [sit arranging for movies for class runtime not fix how many come ...if expected did not come then remained sit will west in memory]
	- hold homogeneous only [container hold same data type]
	- there is no underline data structure 

- when not to use collection fream-work ?
	- PERFORMENCE not up to the mark due to dynamic growing nature
		- when it reach to maz size it is every time create new array and copy no new array and get garbage collected time consuming proccess 

-	 when to use collection fream-work ?
		- when u don`t know size of data to be stored. 	
	
-	when to use when to use Array ?
		-when u know size of data to be stored.


				array                                  				 collection
	------------------------------------------			----------------------------------- 
	- fixed size 										- dynamic  growing nature internally
	- with respect to memory (not recommended )		    -  with respected to memory 
			- fixed so remained west 						- due to dynamic growing nature 
			
	- hold homogeneous only 							- hold homogeneous and  heterogeneous
	
	- there is no underline data structure 				- standard data structure implemented.
	
	- can hold primitive and object type      			- can hold object only

	2) hashcode is unique number is generated by JVM which is nothing but has code 
		
		- hash code is used into hasing related data structure

1) what is thread communication ?


two threads can communicate with each anothers  wait(),notify(),notifyAll().
thread which is expecting updation is responsible to call wait() method then immadiatelly thread will enter into waiting state 
thread wich is responsible to perform updation , aftre performing updation it is responsible to call notify() method then waiting thread get notification
and coutinew its execution with thoese updation item

2) why these method present in to object  wait() , notify(), NotifyAll()?

		1) two threads can communicate with each anothers  wait(),notify(),notifyAll().
		
	 	2) present in object class but not in thread class because thread can call these method any java object.
	
		3) TO CALL 	 wait(),notify(),notifyAll() methods on any object thread thould be owner of that object that is thread should has lock of this object
			that thread should be syncronized area hence we can call wait(),notify(),notifyAll() methods  only from syncronized area another wise we will get runtime exception
			elegalMoniterThreadException
			
		4)	if thread calls wait() method on any object it immadiatelly relese that perticuler object and enter into waiting state 		
			 
		5)  if thread calls notify method on any object it is release the lock of the object may not immadiatelly except  wait(),notify(),notifyAll(),

- What is final parameter?
	
	If you declare any parameter as final, you cannot change the value of it.
	
	class Bike11{  
		int cube(final int n){  
		   n=n+2;//can't be changed as n is final  
		   n*n*n; 
		 }   
  }  
  public static void main(String args[]){  
    Bike11 b=new Bike11();  
    b.cube(5);  
 }  
}  



- Can we declare a constructor final?
		No, because constructor is never inherited.

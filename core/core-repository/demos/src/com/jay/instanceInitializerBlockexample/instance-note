Instance Initialization Blocks :

	- IIB are used to initialize instance variables. 
	- IIBs are executed before constructors and after supper if any supper class .
	- They run each time when object of the class is created.
	 
	 
	- Static initialization blocks will run whenever the class is loaded first time in JVM
	- Initialization blocks run in the same order in which they appear in the program.
	- Instance Initialization blocks are executed whenever the class is initialized and before constructors are invoked. 
	- They are typically placed above the constructors within braces.

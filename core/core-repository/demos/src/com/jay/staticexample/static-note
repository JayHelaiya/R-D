- Restrictions for the static method
		
		- The static method can not use non static data member or call non-static method directly.
		- this and super cannot be used in static context.
		
-  Java static block

		- Is used to initialize the static data member.
		- It is executed before the main method at the time of classloading.
		
		
-  Why is the Java main method static?

		 It is because the object is not required to call a static method. 
		 If it were a non-static method, 
		 JVM creates an object first then call main() method that will lead the problem of extra memory allocation.
